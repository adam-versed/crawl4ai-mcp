## Phase 1: Foundation - Token Management & Summarisation

### 1.1 Token Counting & Management

- [x] ✅ **Add tiktoken dependency** to `pyproject.toml` for accurate token counting
- [x] ✅ **Create token utilities** in `tools/utils.py`:
  - `count_tokens(text: str, model: str = "gpt-4") -> int`
  - `truncate_to_token_limit(text: str, max_tokens: int, model: str = "gpt-4") -> str`
  - `chunk_text_by_tokens(text: str, chunk_size: int, overlap: int = 100) -> List[str]`

### 1.2 MCP Sampling Integration

- [x] ✅ **Add MCP sampling capability** to the server:
  - Create `tools/mcp_sampler.py` with sampling request functionality
  - Add sampling configuration to session manager
  - Implement `request_llm_completion(messages: List[Dict], max_tokens: int = 1000) -> str`

### 1.3 Smart Summarisation Tool

  - `@mcp.tool() async def analyse_content_relevance(content: str, query: str)`
  - `@mcp.tool() async def extract_key_insights(crawl_results: str, focus_areas: List[str])`

---

## Phase 5: Configuration & Optimisation

## Implementation Notes

### Current Architecture Understanding

- **Existing Tools**: `scrape_webpage()`, `crawl_website()`
- **Session Management**: Robust session handling with cleanup
- **Dependencies**: crawl4ai, mcp, httpx
- **Package Manager**: uv (following project rules)

### Key Design Decisions

- **Token Management**: Use tiktoken for accurate counting
- **MCP Sampling**: Leverage existing MCP infrastructure for LLM calls
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Maintain existing tool signatures
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when LLM features fail
- **UK English**: All code and documentation follows UK spelling

### Technical Constraints

- **Context Window**: Implement smart chunking for large content
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect LLM API limits with proper throttling
- **Memory Management**: Efficient handling of large crawl results
- **Session Cleanup**: Proper resource management for long-running operations
